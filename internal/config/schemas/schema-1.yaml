  MachComposerDeployment:
    type: object
    description: |
      The deployment configuration determines the way a component is deployed. The following forms are supported:
      - site: deploy site-based; this means all components will be deployed as part of a single terraform file
      - site-component: deploy site-component based; this means each site component will be deployed as a separate terraform 
      file

      These configurations can be set both at the root level and per site component. The combination of root site with 
      specific site components is also supported (this will deploy all site components as part of a single terraform file,
      excepting the ones that have a specific deployment configuration). The other way around is not supported.

      The default is site.
