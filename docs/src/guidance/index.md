# Architecture guidance overview

Building MACH systems is a significant effort that spans many technologies, systems and methodologies. On this page, we will offer some (opinionated) guidance on how to build MACH systems as a whole.


##[Terraform guidance](./terraform.md)

Terraform is the infrastructure-as-code engine underneath MACH composer. Read more about how to use Terraform (and for what) on this page.

##[Designing your tenancy model](./tenancy.md)

MACH composer is intended to facilitate multi-tenancy on top of a range of MACH services, micro services and integrations. This page describes what to look at when designing your tenancy model, from different perspectives.
