# Concepts

The MACH composer is built around the following concepts

**Compositable serverless microservices architecture**<br>
With first-class support for MACH services.

Develop serverless microservice components and (re-)use and configure them accross multiple environments; each environment can have their own composition of reusable components.
  
**Single configuration file for an entire MACH stack**<br>
One YAML configuration file to manage your commercetools configuration, cloud-based infrastructure and the integration between both.

**Easy replication of environments**<br>
Simply by copy/pasting an existing configuration, make the necessary adjustments and have MACH rollout your new environment.

**Integration with CI/CD process**<br>
Easy to integrate the MACH composer into your (existing) CI/CD pipeline.
