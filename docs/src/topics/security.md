# Security

This document is intended to describe a couple of key points around security.

Aside from use-case specific security considerations for your environment, the main focus for a typical MACH stack would be to:

- Securely configure and store your MACH configuration
- Handle secrets well in your components runtime

## How-to guides

We have described both points in our how-to guides:

- [How to encrypt your MACH configuration](../howto/security/encrypt.md) using SOPS
- [How to handle secrets in your component](../howto/security/handle-secrets.md)
